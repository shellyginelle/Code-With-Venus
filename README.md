# Code With Venus

With the rise of technology, it is no surprise that every aspect of society relies on some form of modern innovation. And although females are “avid users of new technologies, to date, girls and women continue to be significantly underrepresented in technical occupations” [4]. In hopes contribute to the solution, this report showcases, Code with Venus, a tool that teaches web-based programming specifically designed to be appealing and accessible to females in high school. The implementation process encompasses past research methods and results to cater to the primary user group. An evaluation process is proposed in preparation for future evaluation of the produced tool and whether it will render the desired results. The hope is to encourage high school students to choose a degree in computer or information sciences given early exposure to programming. This capstone project aims to illustrate the growth I’ve made throughout my undergraduate career as a computer science student through how I plan, design and execute! 

This software project encompasses the development of a website proof of concept. Utilizing codemirror, fullPage.js and concepts from codecademy, mozilla thimble and scratch. 

### Quickstart

To build the project, make sure you have Node.js installed (at least version 6)
and then `npm install`. To run, just open `index.html` in your
browser (you don't need to run a webserver). Run the tests with `npm test`.

The main page file is located under Venus/fullPage/examples/venus-home.html. Open this
